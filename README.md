Scrub to step in and wipe those pretty emojis and replace them with a string of
your choice.

FAQ
---
Q: Does the emoji remain in the content after the node is saved?

A: Unforunately, no. We had to send your little friend to a farm far, far away.


Q: Emojis are a requirement for my site, are their alternatives that play nice
   with mysql?

A: Yes. There is a php library: http://code.iamcal.com/php/emoji/. Or a core
   patch that can be applied to Drupal to use emojis as seen in this:
